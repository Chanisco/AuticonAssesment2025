## Test results

The first assigment I had to automate a registration, however due to a data leak according to the website we could not use the requested password, I have noted this down in the excel and made sure to update it in the code so we could finish this cycle

#### Below you can see the registration procedure

The second half of the assesment we had to complete a purchase. There were some unforseen situations in the request but this was added into the test to complete the cycle
